# Building AI Agents 🤖🧠

Welcome to the **Agents** section of the AI Bootcamp. While Module 1 gave us "Tools" (Hands), this module focuses on the "Brain" — the code that coordinates everything.

## What is an Agent?
An **Agent** is a program that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) as its reasoning engine to perform multi-step tasks autonomously.

Unlike a simple chatbot, an agent can:
1.  **Plan:** Break a goal into steps.
2.  **Act:** Use tools (like your Weather MCP) to get information.
3.  **Observe:** Read the tool's output and decide what to do next.

## Recommended Resources
*   **[Video: What are AI Agents?](https://youtu.be/ftBWgcwvEk4?si=PnUs5kpVOtsE6HoJ)** - A highly recommended high-level overview of AI Agents and how they work.

## 2. Agent Basics (Module 2)
Learn how to talk to an LLM via code and build a simple autonomous loop.

1.  **[LLM vs. Agent](./basics/learn-llm-vs-agent.md):** Understanding the "Chef vs. Kitchen" analogy.
2.  **[Hello Agent](./basics/guide-hello-agent.md):** Writing your first Python script to talk to an LLM API.
3.  **[Gemini API Reference](./basics/ref-gemini-api.md):** Rate limits and privacy info (2026).
4.  **[Guide: Weather Agent](./basics/guide-weather-agent.md):** The "Think-Act-Observe" loop. Connect your Weather functions to the LLM and build an autonomous agent.

## 3. Smart Agents: The Daily Briefing (Module 3)
Take your agents to the next level by adding **Persistence**, **Guardrails**, and **Scheduling**.

*   **[Module 3 Home Page](./smart-agent/README.md):** Overview of the Daily Briefing project and the four pillars of AI engineering.

## Prerequisites
*   **API Key:** You will need an API key from an LLM provider (Anthropic or Gemini).
*   **Python:** Basic knowledge of Python functions.
