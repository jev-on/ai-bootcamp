# Module 2: Building AI Agents

In Module 1 (MCP), we built "Tools" (Hands). In Module 2, we will build the LLM that controls them.

## What is an Agent?
An **Agent** is a program that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) as its reasoning engine to perform multi-step tasks autonomously.

Unlike a simple chatbot, an agent can:
1.  **Plan:** Break a goal into steps.
2.  **Act:** Use tools (like your Weather MCP) to get information.
3.  **Observe:** Read the tool's output and decide what to do next.

## Learning Path
1.  **[Hello Agent](./guide-hello-agent.md):** Writing your first Python script to talk to an LLM API.
2.  **[Gemini API Reference](./gemini-reference.md):** Rate limits and privacy info (2026).
3.  **[Guide: Weather Agent](./guide-weather-agent.md):** Connect your Weather functions to the LLM and build an autonomous loop.
3.  **The Loop:** (Coming Soon) Building the "Think-Act-Observe" loop.

## Prerequisites
*   **API Key:** You will need an API key from an LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini).
*   **Python:** Basic knowledge of Python functions.
