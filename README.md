# ai-bootcamp

Welcome to the AI Bootcamp! This repository is a dedicated space for learning the basics of Artificial Intelligence. 

Here, we explore core concepts, build hands-on projects, and document our journey from AI beginners to advanced practitioners.

## Curriculum Modules

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
The [Model Context Protocol](./mcp/) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect to external data and tools.

*   **[Overview](./mcp/README.md)**: High-level concepts and architecture.
*   **[Guide: Calculator MCP](./mcp/guide-calculator-mcp.md)**: Build a simple, local MCP server (No internet required).
*   **[Guide: Weather MCP](./mcp/guide-weather-mcp.md)**: Build an internet-connected MCP server that uses APIs and tool-chaining.

### 2. Building AI Agents
Move beyond static tools. Build Python programs that can "think" and act autonomously.

*   **[Overview](./agent/README.md)**: What is an Agent?
*   **[Guide: Hello Agent](./agent/guide-hello-agent.md)**: Your first programmatic call to an LLM API.

### Future Modules
*   **Module 3: Smart Agents**: Giving your agent Memory, Safety (Human-in-the-loop), and Planning capabilities.
*   **Module 4: The Platform**: Building a Universal MCP Client to connect to *any* tool ecosystem.
