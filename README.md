Welcome to the AI Bootcamp! This repository is a dedicated space for learning the basics of Artificial Intelligence. 

Here, we explore core concepts, build hands-on projects, and document our journey from AI beginners to advanced practitioners. Our first module focuses on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which you can find in the `mcp/` directory.
