Welcome to the AI Bootcamp! This repository is a dedicated space for learning the basics of Artificial Intelligence. 

Here, we explore core concepts, build hands-on projects, and document our journey from AI beginners to advanced practitioners.

## 🎓 Curriculum Path

### 🛠️ Phase 1: The Foundation (Tools)
Focuses on building the "Hands" of the AI using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Module 1: Model Context Protocol**
*   **Concepts:**
    *   **[Overview](./mcp/README.md)**: High-level concepts and architecture.
*   **Guides (Build It):**
    *   **[1. Calculator MCP](./mcp/guide-calculator-mcp.md)**: Your first local tool (No internet required).
    *   **[2. Weather MCP](./mcp/guide-weather-mcp.md)**: Connecting to real-world APIs and tool-chaining.

### 🧠 Phase 2: The Intelligence (Agents)
Focuses on building the "Brain" and the autonomous logic loops.

**Module 2: Agent Basics**
*   **Concepts:**
    *   **[Overview](./agent/README.md)**: What is an Agent?
    *   **[LLM vs Agent](./agent/basics/learn-llm-vs-agent.md)**: Understanding the Chef vs. Kitchen analogy.
    *   **[Reference: Gemini API](./agent/basics/ref-gemini-api.md)**: Understanding models and rate limits.
*   **Guides (Build It):**
    *   **[1. Hello Agent](./agent/basics/guide-hello-agent.md)**: Making your first programmatic LLM call.
    *   **[2. Weather Agent](./agent/basics/guide-weather-agent.md)**: Building the full "Think-Act-Observe" loop.

### 🤖 Phase 3: The System (Automation)
Focuses on building "Production-Ready" agents that work autonomously in the background.

**Module 3: Smart Agents (The Daily Briefing)**
*   **Concepts:**
    *   **[Module Overview](./agent/smart-agent/README.md)**: The 5 Pillars of AI Engineering (Side Effects, Guardrails, Persistence, Reflection, Orchestration).
*   **Guides (Build It):**
    *   **[1. Notification Tools](./agent/smart-agent/guide-notification-tools.md)**: Building Email and Discord MCPs.
    *   **[2. The Briefing Agent](./agent/smart-agent/guide-briefing-agent.md)**: Putting it all together.
    *   **[3. Self-Correction](./agent/smart-agent/guide-reflection.md)**: Building an agent that checks its own work.
    *   **[4. Scheduling](./agent/smart-agent/guide-scheduling.md)**: Setting the agent on autopilot.

### 🚀 Roadmap (Future Modules)
*   **Module 4: The Platform**: Building a Universal MCP Client using system pipes to connect to ANY tool ecosystem.
